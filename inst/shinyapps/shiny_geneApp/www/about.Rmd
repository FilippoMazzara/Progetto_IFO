# About the GeneApp project

### Development

This web application is written using the R Shiny web framework. It makes use of custom HTML, CSS and JS, \
It also demonstrates the use various Rmarkdown templates, all in order to create a fancy user experience. \
It is also encapsulated inside a Docker container for better portability and control. \
The app was developed with best Shiny practices in mind, as the use of Shiny modules, reactivity and fast server side processing, 
to name a few. In total about 5000 lines of code were written for this app in a few months. \
This time included app design and development but also all the required research to program in R, a language that was foreign to me. 
Here are listed just some of the invaluable sources I used to gather all this knowledge:\

  + [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)\
  + [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)\
  + [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html) \
  + [Engineering Shiny](https://engineering-shiny.org/index.html) \
  + [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/)\
  + [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)\

Other key R packages that were used for this project are DT, data.tables, shinyWidgets, shinyFiles, knitr, maftools for all the genetic analysis needs and the tidyverse packages for the handling of the data.

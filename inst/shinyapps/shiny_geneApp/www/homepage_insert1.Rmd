GeneApp is a browser-based interface for interactive exploratory analysis of genomic data in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). \

The ultimate goal of the project is to provide an intuitive interface, with a comprehensive set of tools, \
that will help researchers to import, explore and visualize mutational data of large cancer genomics studies. \
Users also have the opportunity to download summaries and reports in various formats to best reflect their analysis. \
All the details about the app are listed in the help section.\

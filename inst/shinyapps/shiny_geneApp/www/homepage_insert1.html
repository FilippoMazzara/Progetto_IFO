<p>GeneApp is a browser-based interface for interactive exploratory
analysis of genomic data in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to provide an intuitive
interface, with a comprehensive set of tools,<br />
that will help researchers to import, explore and visualize mutational
data of large cancer genomics studies.<br />
Users also have the opportunity to download summaries and reports in
various formats to best reflect their analysis.<br />
All the details about the app are listed in the help section.<br />
